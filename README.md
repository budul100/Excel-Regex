# Excel-Regex
![In-use screenshot](Additionals/screenshot.png?raw=true "UDF Screenshot")

This compiled Excel add-in brings regular expressions from C# into any Excel worksheet through two new functions:
* RegexMatches: boolean check for whether an input string matches the regular expression
* RegexExtract: for extracting matches of a regular expression from an input string

Both functions feature user-friendly tooltips to get you started. The regular expression syntax used is the [MS Regular Expression Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference).

This project is based on [darrenhewett/Excel-Regex](https://github.com/darrenhewett/Excel-Regex).
